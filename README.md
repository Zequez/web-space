# Web Space

A self-hosted open source website builder for a culture of collaboration.

Goals and features:

- Modify any part of the system code
- Web-accessible file-based content management
- Use your own domain names without any additional cost
- Deploy as a progressive web app (so you can install the website as an app on phones)
- Build the web like legos with community components
- Multi-domain support; manage multiple websites with a single deployment

I'll stop now with the features because I don't want the mountain too big; let us climb this mountain
and see where we go from there. Also I want to get started with building a proof of concept.
